# IEC Pin Configuration Example
# Copy to /workspace/policy/pins.txt to protect specific files/models from cleanup
#
# Pin types:
#   model:name     - Protect models containing 'name' in path
#   folder:path    - Protect entire folder and contents
#   /absolute/path - Protect specific absolute path
#   *.pattern      - Protect files matching glob pattern
#
# Lines starting with # are comments and ignored

# Example: Pin specific models (keeps models even in Nuclear mode)
# model:flux1-dev
# model:stable-diffusion-xl
# model:llama-2-7b

# Example: Pin important folders
# folder:/workspace/models/core
# folder:/workspace/data/state/important-configs

# Example: Pin specific files
# /workspace/data/state/filebrowser/critical-settings.json
# /workspace/models/custom-trained-model.safetensors

# Example: Pin patterns (use carefully)
# *.important
# /workspace/data/outputs/client-*

# Common pins for production use:

# 1. Core models that are expensive to re-download
# model:flux1-dev
# model:clip_l
# model:t5xxl_fp16

# 2. Important application state
# folder:/workspace/data/state/filebrowser
# folder:/workspace/data/state/comfyui-manager

# 3. Custom trained models
# /workspace/models/custom/*

# 4. Critical configuration files
# /workspace/privacy/allowlist.txt
# /workspace/policy/pins.txt

# NOTES:
# - Pins are respected in all cleanup modes unless CLEANUP_IGNORE_PINS=1
# - Nuclear mode with --force will ignore pins (dangerous)
# - Use 'ignition-cleanup discover' to find paths that might need pinning
# - Pin the minimum necessary - over-pinning reduces cleanup effectiveness

# Test your pins with:
# ignition-cleanup dry-run    # Shows what would be deleted
# ignition-cleanup basic      # Test basic cleanup
# ignition-cleanup enhanced   # Test enhanced cleanup
